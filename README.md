# Finding the derivative of polynomials via double limit

## Abstract

Differentiation is process of finding the derivative, or rate of change, of a function.
Derivative itself is defined by the limit of function's change divided by the function's argument change
as change tends to zero.
In particular, for polynomials the function's change is calculated via Binomial expansion.
This manuscript provides another approach to reach polynomial's function change as a limit of certain polynomial identity,
and therefore expressing the derivative of polynomial as double limit.
